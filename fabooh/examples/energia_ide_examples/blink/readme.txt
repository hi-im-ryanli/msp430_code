blink.ino - Energia sample

This is not the normal way of using fabooh. We provide this 
example so you can test building fabooh code inside of the
Energia IDE.

If you just want to use makefiles you don't need to use Energia.
Although you might want to use the msp430-gcc toolchain for
your Operating System that is bundled with the download.
