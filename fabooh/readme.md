FABOOH - as in FABricate meets OOH La La
----------------------------------------
o What is Fabooh?

Fabooh started out as a C++ template based peripheral framework for the
msp430 uC.  It creates very small and efficient code while still
providing a flexible framework akin to what you might expect in Energia.
 
o Why do you want it?

Typically it is used by someone who wants to do more with an msp430g2231
than is possible with Energia. You might also want to try it out if you
like C++ object abstraction and feel comfortable with C++ templates.
You might even try it out if you want to see if it generates smaller code
than your hand optimized straight 'C' code doing the same thing. You
might be surprised at the results.  blink.elf is about 152 bytes.
ascii_table.elf is only 468 bytes ( it uses the serial port to print
out ASCII characters in raw, decimal, oct, hex, and binary versions ).

o Where can I get it?

o How much does it cost?

Gratis, but I'm glad to take a donation.
